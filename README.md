## Introduction

The `_printf` function in this repository provides an alternative implementation of the `printf` function, allowing you to format and print text in a specified way. It supports various formatting options, including flags, width, precision, and data types.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/adamsadeyiga/printf.git
   ```

2. Include the necessary files in your project, such as `main.h` and the `_printf` implementation.

3. Use the `_printf` function in your code just like you would use the standard `printf` function.

## Function Description

The `_printf` function takes a format string and a variable number of arguments, similar to the standard `printf` function. It processes the format string and replaces format specifiers with the corresponding values of the provided arguments. The function supports various format specifiers, flags, and options, allowing you to customize the output.

## Examples

```c
#include "main.h"

int main(void)
{
    int num = 42;
    char *str = "Hello, world!";

    _printf("Number: %d\n", num);
    _printf("String: %s\n", str);

    return (0);
}
```

Output:

```
Number: 42
String: Hello, world!
```
